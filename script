Based on the Book by Dr. Seuss
INT: THEATER - DAY
The Lorax steps onto the stage in front of a large curtain and addresses the camera.
LORAX
Hello, everybody. Thanks for
coming.
The Lorax CLEARS his throat and reads from a card he holds.
LORAX (CONT’D)
I am the Lorax. I speak for the
trees.
And I’d like to say a few words, if you please,
Regarding the story that you’re ‘bout to see--
It actually happened--just take it from me.
But there’s more to this story than what’s on the page,
So please pay attention while I set the stage.
The Lorax tosses the card at the audience and walks off as the curtain opens, revealing Thneedville.
EXT. THNEEDVILLE - DAY
TWO MAINTENANCE WORKERS work on a large “Welcome to Thneedville” sign. The slogan below it reads, “Fantastic! Made of plastic! 100% Inorganic.” The camera pushes past them and flies through the town, down to a suburban street.
LORAX (V.O.)
We open in Thneedville, a city,
they say,
That was plastic and fake, and they liked it that way.
A Town Without Nature. Not one living tree.
So what happened to them?
Cue the music!
Let’s see...
EXT. THNEEDVILLE - PRESENT - MORNING
SONG: “THNEEDVILLE”
The MUSIC starts up on a LONG SHOT down the street of Thneedville suburbs.

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 2.
All of the houses look basically the same. Electric trees line the streets instead of street lamps.
An O’Hare Air delivery truck drives down the street.
FLOOSH! An INFLATABLE PLASTIC BUSH inflates. FLOOSH! Another. FLOOSH! Another. Then--
POP! a bed of PLASTIC FLOWERS pops up in time with the music complete with PLASTIC BUZZING BEES attached to wires.
PLASTIC BEES (mechanical voice)
Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!
The DELIVERY MAN gets out of the truck and grabs an air bottle from it. He replaces an empty, used air bottle with a new one like a milkman.

EXT: TED’S HOUSE - PRESENT - SAME
Nearby, TED, an 11-year-old boy and our hero, hops out of his second floor bedroom window, down a series of stairs, and flips over the railing into the air and lands on his SCOOTER.
He snaps on his goggles, revs his engine, and takes off down the street. PULL BACK TO A WIDE SHOT of the entire neighborhood.
All of the front doors of the houses open simultaneously and the PEOPLE OF THNEEDVILLE exit their houses singing happily.
EVERYONE
In Thneedville it’s a brand new dawn!
PEOPLE drive by in their personalized vanity cars, including a BUSINESSMAN in his large STEAMROLLER SUV.

The Snowboarding Teen turns and sends a CLUMP OF SLUSH flying and it goes down the back of a GUY’S SWIMSUIT.
EVERYONE (CONT'D) We surf and snowboard right in
town!
A group of SUNBATHERS sing like a church choir, holding their sun reflectors like choir folders.
SUNBATHING CHOIR
We thank the Lord for all we’ve got!
The Singing Delivery Man sings a beautiful solo as we reveal that the choir is singing at the grand opening of a new PARKING LOT (called Thneedville Parking).
SUNBATHING MAN
Including this brand new parking lot!
As the choir sings with religious fervor about the parking lot, people step our of their parked vehicles, get on the roofs of their cars, and JOYOUSLY sing along.
EVERYONE
Parking lot! Parking lot!
Nearby a WOMAN and her SON fly kites propelled by large fans.
It’s him!
WOMAN WITH KITE
Everyone looks up and sees the O’HARE AIR BLIMP, which spews out smog from its exhaust. Projected on it’s massive LCD screen is ALOYSIUS O’HARE, the financial king of Thneedville, owner of the O’Hare Air Co. Pudgy and clownish and tacky and loved by everyone. He leans out from the window and waves to the people down below.
EVERYONE
Ooh look! It’s Aloysius O’Hare (Aloysius O’Hare)

O’Hare stands on Mooney’s hands outside the door.
O’HARE

He dives off and falls down toward the ground. His parachute opens revealing an ad for O’Hare Air.
EVERYONE
Hip-hooray, hip-hooray!
As they celebrate we catch up with Ted, who is excitedly buying a REMOTE CONTROL AIRPLANE from a VENDOR at his kiosk. He gives the vendor his money and takes the new airplane, ecstatic.
EVERYONE (CONT’D)
Hip-hip-hooray!
We're in the center of town. Here comes the elaborately choreographed big finish, reminiscent of “Consider Yourself” from Oliver.
The huge mob engulfs Ted at the toy kiosk. People dance with their shopping bags, tossing them to each other. Businesspeople dance with their briefcases.
EVERYONE (CONT’D)
In Thneedville
We love living this way!
Suddenly the Singing Delivery Man reappears in frame, pushes the BAND LEADER aside, grabs his baton, and leads the MARCHING BAND down the street.
SINGING DELIVERY MAN
It’s like living in paradise!
EVERYONE
It’s perfect!
And that’s how it will stay!

As soon as the song's over, everyone immediately goes back to what they were doing. Mooney and McGurk help the frozen Singing Delivery Man off the roof of the limo.
And out of the crowd zips Ted on his scooter, carrying the bag with the airplane in it.
EXT: THNEEDVILLE - PRESENT - SAME
Ted rides his scooter through town with the confidence of someone who knows the place like the back of his hand.
EXT: AUDREY’S HOUSE - PRESENT - CONTINUOUS
He ends up suburbia. Stops in front of a house. Gets off of his scooter. Reaches into the bag and pulls out the REMOTE- CONTROLLED AIRPLANE. Ted smiles as he admires it.
Ted places it on the ground. Operates the remote control, and it TAKES OFF. Ted then flies the plane in a series of loop-dee-loops and then straight into someone’s backyard. But instead of being upset, he smiles.
TED Yes.
He runs up to the front door of the house. RINGS the doorbell. Multiple times. As the door opens, Ted goes into a slow-mo fantasy, revealing--
AUDREY. A teenage girl, beautiful and cool, and much too old for Ted. Although he doesn’t see it that way. He looks up at her worshipfully, suddenly awkward in her presence.
AUDREY Oh, hi, Ted.

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 8.
Ted breaks out of the fantasy.
TED
(trying to play it cool)
Oh, hey, Audrey. Hi.
AUDREY
Did your ball land in my backyard
again?
TED
What?! No. Model airplane. This
time.
Audrey smiles. Then leans in to Ted, conspiratorially.
AUDREY
Hey--do you wanna see something
cool?
Ted stares back at Audrey. Are you kidding me?
Come on!
AUDREY (CONT’D)
Audrey turns to go into the house. Ted follows her, spraying breath freshener into his mouth as he enters.
EXT: AUDREY’S BACKYARD - PRESENT - LATER
Audrey takes her hands away from Ted’s eyes and he looks up to see a MASSIVE MURAL in progress on the wall depicting a lush valley filled with TRUFFULA TREES. Ted stares up at the painting in awe.
TED
Whoa. Did you p-- Did you paint
this?
AUDREY Do you like it?
TED
What?! Are you kidding? This is
amazing.
(points to trees)
What are those?
AUDREY (smiles)
Those are trees. Real ones.
They used to grow all around here.
(MORE)

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 9.
AUDREY (CONT'D)
And people said that the touch of
their tufts was softer than anything, even silk. And they smelled like butterfly milk.
TED
Wow. What does that even mean?
AUDREY I know, right?
Audrey grabs Ted’s arms and swings him over her head, so they both fall to the ground.
TED Whaaaa!
(pained) Oh yeah.
AUDREY
What I want more than anything in
the whole world is to see a real living tree, growing in my backyard.
TED (thinking)
So...if, say-- I’m just thinking out loud here... if a guy somehow got you one...
AUDREY
Well, I’d probably marry him on the
spot.
(makes a face)
I bet that sounds crazy. Does that sound crazy?
Ted looks up adoringly at Audrey.
TED No. Not crazy!
(clears his throat) Not crazy at all.
Ted smiles. A boy with a plan.
INT: DINING ROOM - PRESENT - NIGHT
Ted sits at the dinner table with his MOM and GRAMMY NORMA. He absentmindedly pokes at a PIECE OF JELLO shaped like BROCCOLI.

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 10.
TED’S MOM
Ted, honey, don’t play with your
food. You either, Mom.
Grammy Norma dribbles a JELLO BROCCOLI like a She tosses it up and pops it in her mouth.
TED
So...Mom. Do you happen to know if
there’s like anyplace where I could get a real tree?
Grammy Norma reacts to this.
TED’S MOM
Ted, we already have a tree. It’s
the latest model.
TED
Yeah, but I mean like a real one,
that-- that grows out of the ground or whatever. You know, like a real tree.
TED’S MOM (makes face)
Really? You’d rather have some dirty, messy lump of wood that just sticks out of the ground and it does what? I don’t even know what it does. What’s it’s purpose? Look what we’ve got. It’s the Oak- a-matic--the only tree with its own remote!
She points a REMOTE at the tree outside.
TED’S MOM (CONT’D) Summer, autumn, winter--
The tree changes with each click to match the

The tree now lights up in neon colors like a disco floor. And plays a Muzak version of “The Hustle.” Ted’s Mom shimmies and sings along.

doot doot! Come on, Ted, get into it, dance with the tree.

Ted sinks in his seat, mortified.
TED
Mom... Oh, it hurts Mom. Please
stop.
Ted’s Mom clicks the remote and the music stops.
TED (CONT’D)
Sooooo, anyway, let’s just say I
need a tree. Where would I go? What do I do?
GRAMMY NORMA
Then you know what? You’d need to
find the Once-ler.
Ted turns to Grammy Norma, surprised.
TED The-- the what?
TED’S MOM
Mom, it’s not really the time for
one of your, you know, magical fables, okay?
GRAMMY NORMA
Oh, that’s right. I forgot. I’m
old and can’t even remember to put my teeth in.
TED’S MOM
Stand down. That’s not what I
meant.
GRAMMY NORMA
No really, I forgot my teeth.
Would you be a dear and go get them for me?
TED’S MOM (sighs)
Sure, mom.
She exits. As soon as she’s gone Grammy Norma plops in her teeth and turns dramatically to Ted.
GRAMMY NORMA (conspiratorially)
Okay, here’s the deal. The Once- ler is the man who knows what happened to the trees. You want one, you need to find him.

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax
1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 12.
TED (suspicious)
“The Once-ler”? Mmm-hm, okay. Grammy is this a real thing that we’re talking about now?
GRAMMY NORMA Oh, he’s real, all right.
TED
Well...where can I find him?
Grammy Norma appears behind Ted, scaring him. She gives him an intense look. CLAPS and the LIGHTS DIM.
GRAMMY NORMA “Far outside of town
where the grass never grows
and the wind smells slow-and-sour when it blows
(makes spooky wind noises) ...and no birds ever sing excepting old crows...”
(suddenly) CAW!!!
Ted jumps. Grammy Norma catches him.
TED
Whoa! Quit doing that!
GRAMMY NORMA
That’s the place where the Once-ler
lives.
TED
Wait--outside of town?
INT: TED’S BEDROOM - PRESENT - EVENING
Ted empties an old jar filled with coins and collects THREE NICKELS.
GRAMMY NORMA (V.O.) People used to say if you brought
him fifteen cents...
INT: KITCHEN - PRESENT - EVENING
RATTLE! Ted opens up the junk drawer and retrieves a NAIL.

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 13.
GRAMMY NORMA (V.O.) ...a nail...
EXT: TED’S HOUSE - PRESENT - EVENING
Ted searches around for snails. Picks a shell up. A GREAT- GREAT-GREAT-GRANDFATHER SNAIL, wrinkled and with a long beard, pops out.
GRAMMY NORMA (V.O.) ...and the shell of a great-great- great grandfather snail, he’d tell
you everything.
Ted smiles. He’s got everything he needs.
EXT: FAR END OF TOWN - PRESENT - NIGHT
Ted rides his scooter through to the edge of
up and sees a large pipe above his head with
“VENT OUT.” He follows the pipe which leads to a door high up in the middle of the wall. There is no way to get to it.
Nearby, Ted spots a box on the wall with a warning sign which reads, “AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.” Ted looks around, opens the box, and pushes the red button inside, which extends a brick from the wall out towards him.
TED Whoa!
Other bricks extend out forming a staircase up to the door.
Ted gets back on his scooter and rides it up the stairs to the door where he sees a sign reading, “Outside of Town.” He turns a lever and the door opens like a bank vault.
A RED LIGHT above the door starts blinking.
The camera continues up into the sky, where the O’Hare Air Blimp hovers above.

MARKETING GUY #1
Mr. O’Hare, what we’ve got for you is something that is going to take
O’Hare Air to the next level.
MARKETING GUY #2
Now, Mr. O’Hare, I know what you’re
thinking. One, I’ve gotten rich selling people air that’s fresher than the stinky stuff outside. Two, here’s the important one, how could I possibly make even more money?
(laughs)
We can tell you, sir, we can tell you!
MARKETING GUY #1
Check out this commercial. Huh?!
He clicks his remote and a COMMERCIAL appears on a screen.
EXT: ROOFTOP - COMMERCIAL - DAY
TWO GUYS sit in chairs on a rooftop.
FIRST GUY
Well, here goes another lame
Saturday.
SECOND GUY Dude...I don't think so.
(chuckles)
He smiles and pulls a six-pack of O'HARE AIR out of a cooler.
Huh?
FIRST GUY
Pops one open, funky music begins playing, the sun comes out, and suddenly a bunch of BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE show up.
Hey!
Oh, yeah! Man!
Oh yeah!
FIRST GUY (CONT’D)
SECOND GUY Right here.
FIRST GUY SECOND GUY

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 15. TWO MEN open bottles and blow the air into their mouths.
FIRST GUY Whaaaaa?!
A hot chick opens up a bottle in her face and it makes her hair blow sexily. The First Guy is amazed. Instant party! He and his buddy click their bottles together.
ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
O'Hare Purified Air. Freshness to
go!
(beat)
Please breathe responsibly.
INT: O’HARE’S OFFICE - PRESENT - SAME
The commercial over O’Hare rubs his forehead.
MARKETING GUY #1
Love it.
Yeah... Then he speaks.
O’HARE
You gotta be kidding me! You
really think people are stupid enough to buy this?!
The Marketing Guys keep pushing each other out of the way, vying for O’Hare’s attention.
MARKETING GUY #1
Our research shows that if you put
something in a plastic bottle, people will buy it.
MARKETING GUY #2 Exactly, and--
Marketing Guy #1 shoves Marketing Guy #2 aside and points to a chart showing air quality going down and sales going up.
Huh?
Oh my goodness.
MARKETING GUY #2 MARKETING GUY #1 MARKETING GUY #2

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 16.
MARKETING GUY #1
And what’s more, when we build a
new factory to make the plastic bottles, the air quality’s just going to get worse.
MARKETING GUY #2
Which will make people want our air even more and drive sales... where?
Through the roof! O’Hare nods his approval.
O’HARE
So in other words: the more smog in
the sky... (chuckles)
...the more people will buy. The Marketing Guys laugh.
MARKETING GUY #2 Genius! That’s why he’s a genius!
MARKETING GUY #1 It even rhymes!
O’HARE I’m aware it rhymes.
Suddenly a RED LIGHT on O’Hare’s desk starts flashing. He looks at it. The door opens and his thugs MOONEY and MCGURK step in. The Marketing Guys grab their charts and run off.
MARKETING GUY #2 (O.S.) Coats! Big coats!
O’HARE
What do you two knuckleheads want?!
I’m in the middle of a meeting!
Mooney holds out a HANDHELD DEVICE. It reads “SECURITY ALERT,” and shows BLACK AND WHITE FOOTAGE of Ted trying to get out the door.
O’Hare stares at it. Frowns.
O’HARE (CONT’D)
What?! Why is he leaving town? No
one ever leaves town! (beat)
See what he’s up to.

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 17.
INT: WALL - PRESENT - NIGHT
Ted looks in though the door in the wall, revealing a large, dark room. He rides through the maze-like room on his scooter, passing a stream of gluppity-glup pouring out from a series of pipes.
TED Whoa!
A security camera watches him drive by. He continues over the stream on a small bridge until he reaches an exit.
EXT: OUTSIDE OF TOWN - PRESENT - CONTINUOUS
Ted comes out into the world outside of town. It’s a desolate landscape. Filled with garbage and filthy water and tree stumps.
TED Huh?
He’s seeing his world as it really is. And it’s a nightmare.
Ted steels himself and continues on past the graveyard of tree stumps.
A storm brews in the smoggy sky and he looks up to see an old Thneed billboard. Lightning FLASHES, distracting Ted, who is almost beheaded by a series of old, rusted axe blades. He dodges and weaves through them. He looks behind him to reveal it’s a destroyed Axe Hacker. Lightning FLASHES in the sky again.
Oh, man...
TED (CONT’D)
Ted stops at a large ravine where a bridge is out. He looks around to see if there is another way to cross and spots some old barrels and a plank of wood. He gets an idea.
EXT: RAVINE - PRESENT - LATER
Ted revs his scooter and then takes off toward the ravine where he has setup the barrel and the plank of wood as a makeshift ramp. He intends to jump it, but as he reaches the end of the ramp he plummets down the side.
He SCREAMS, but picks up so much speed that he drives right back up the other side. He flies into the air and bounces back down. He breathes a SIGH OF RELIEF and continues on his journey up the side of a mountain pass.

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 18.
EXT: DESOLATION - PRESENT - CONTINUOUS
The city is far behind him now. Ted scooters through the fog, past warning signs reading, “Stay out!” and “I mean it!” and down the worn path where he comes to a stop in front of a hand-painted street sign covered in CROWS. He gets off his scooter and as he approaches it, the crows take off, revealing that it reads “The Street of the Lifted Lorax.”
He keeps moving forward through the fog until he comes to a rickety old shack with a boarded-up window that looks like a strong wind might knock it over (otherwise known as The Lerkim). Ted stares at the spooky image, frozen. Then takes a deep breath and continues up the hill.
TED Whoa... All right...
He arrives in front of the Lerkim, which only looks creepier up close. He continues forward, not noticing that someone is watching him from inside the boarded up window.
Ted walks past a small ring of stones. The word “Unless” is carved into one of them.
Ted removes the money, nail, and snail from his pocket. The snail shakes his head, giving Ted a look like, “Let’s get out of here.”
Ted ignores the snail and heads up the steps leading to the front door. The wind whistles, and the old wood CREAKS beneath his feet. He gets more nervous with each step. The railing falls over scaring him. Then he arrives at the door with a sign above it reading, “THE ONCE-LER”. Ted stares at it, then takes a deep breath and moves his shaking finger toward the doorbell. He presses it then--
WHIRRRRRRRR...CLANK! Immediately a crazy Seussian machine is activated.
TED (CONT’D)
Okay...
It catapults him into the air.
TED (CONT’D) What the--?!
A clamp catches by the seat of his pants just before he hits the ground and hoists him back up into the air.
TED (CONT’D) Aiiiiiiiii!

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 19.
KA-LUNK! The contraption comes to a stop, leaving Ted dangling in front of the Lerkim. He opens his eyes, surprised to be alive. Struggles to get loose.
Two YELLOW EYES and two GREEN-GLOVED ARMS appear in the window. Ted, still hanging upside-down, stares at them, horrified.
ONCE-LER (O.S.) Who are you?!
TED Aaaaaaaah!
Ted squirms and wriggles like a worm on a hook. The voice barks even louder.
ONCE-LER (O.S.)
WHO ARE YOU?! And what are you
doing here?!
TED
(out of breath)
I’m Ted. I’m Ted! Oh, can’t breathe. Are you--are you...the Once-ler? Oh, man.
ONCE-LER (O.S.)
Didn’t you read the signs? No one
is supposed to come here!
The clamp spins Ted around, lowers him to the ground and lets him go. Then it begins pushing him back down the path toward Thneedville.
ONCE-LER (O.S.) (CONT'D) Get out of here and leave me alone!
And don’t let the boot hit you on the way out.
TED The boot?
A mechanical boot kicks Ted in the butt.
TED (CONT’D) Whoa, hello! Ow...
He stops and turns back around, holding out the payment in his hand.

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 20.
TED (CONT’D)
Listen, people say that if someone
brings you this stuff that you’ll tell them about trees!
There’s a pause. That word got the Once-ler’s attention. The mechanical arm comes back and grabs Ted again bringing him up to the window.
TED (CONT’D) Oh, no-no-no-no! Whoa.
Trees?
ONCE-LER (O.S.)
TED
Yeah. Real ones, you know, that
grow out of the ground. A very long pause.
Hello?
TED (CONT’D)
ONCE-LER (O.S.) Sorry...it’s just... Well, I
didn’t think anyone still cared about trees.
TED
Well, that’s me! The guy who still
cares. I’m here! Hey, what-- Whoa!
The mechanical arm deposits Ted on the pile of rocks.
ONCE-LER (O.S.) You want to know about trees?
About what happened to them? Why they’re all gone?
Ted looks up at the window.
ONCE-LER (O.S.) (CONT’D) (whispers)
It’s because of me.
A look of shock comes over Ted’s face.
TED Wait, what?
The Once-ler lowers a long metal tube, the Whisper-Ma-Phone, out of his window. Ted leans in to listen.

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 21.
ONCE-LER (O.S.) It’s because of me!
The Whisper-Ma-Phone blows out dust causing Ted to COUGH.
ONCE-LER (O.S.) (CONT’D) And my invention. The Thneed. It
was an amazing product that could do the job of a thousand!
The Once-ler holds a Thneed out and shows it to Ted.
TED
Alright...sounds ridiculous. But,
I mean, that’s cool.
ONCE-LER (O.S.) You’re darn right it was cool!
(sighs)
It all started a long time ago...
TED
Can we start not so long ago maybe?
ONCE-LER (O.S.) Do you want a tree?
TED Yes. Yes...
ONCE-LER (O.S.)
Then it all started a long, long
time ago...
EXT: ONCE-LER FAMILY HOME - PAST - DAY
Cross dissolve from Old Once-ler to a much younger Once-ler sitting on a COVERED WAGON which is hitched to a sad-looking mule named MELVIN in front of a nice house with a CAR parked in front. Standing there to see him off are his MOTHER, his moronic brothers BRETT and CHET, his monstrous GREAT-AUNT GRIZELDA, and his unctuous UNCLE UBB.
ONCE-LER (V.O.)
I was a young man leaving home...
ONCE-LER
Well, here I go, Mom. Off to
change the world with my Thneed! I’m actually doin’ it!

ONCE-LER’S MOM
Yes. (sweetly)
But just remember, Oncie--if somehow your invention ends up a failure instead of a success...
(abruptly switches gear) Well, it wouldn’t surprise me at all!
The family LAUGHS at this.
UNCLE UBB
Hey!
Chet punches Once-ler in the arm.
CHET Nice wheels! Burn!
Melvin kicks Chet back over toward the family. The Once-ler LAUGHS IT OFF.
ONCE-LER
Haha. Yeah, burn! But you’ll see,
okay--I’m gonna prove you all wrong! C’mon, Melvin!
More laughter from the family. The Once-ler tries to ignore this.
EXT: DESERT - PAST - DAY
The wagon makes its way across a country road. The Once-ler strums his ELECTRIC GUITAR.
ONCE-LER (V.O.)
So there I was at the very bottom with nothing but a wagon, a mule, and a completely irrational sense
of optimism.
ONCE-LER (singing)
Na na nana na na

EXT: MOUNTAIN PASS - PAST - DAY
The Once-ler sleeps as MELVIN his mule continues on.
ONCE-LER (V.O.)
But I’d had absolutely no success.
Until one day...I found paradise... Melvin kicks the Once-ler awake.
ONCE-LER (startled)
Oh! We’re gonna be there soon! I’m sure it’s like-- Whoa!
PULL BACK TO REVEAL:
The TRUFFULA VALLEY. It is paradise. They look around and see blue skies, green grass, a flowing river, woodland creatures and hundreds of tall TRUFFULA TREES with their colorful tufts swaying in the afternoon breeze. It’s magical.
ONCE-LER (CONT’D)
This is the most beautiful place,
okay, I have ever seen.
The music swells. Then the Once-ler looks down to see THREE HUMMING-FISH walk up and strike a pose in front of him. They look up and gesture towards the beautiful valley behind them.
HUMMING-FISH
They each HUM as they dive off into a nearby pond.
Taa-daa!
Whoa!
ONCE-LER
The Once-ler watches as the Humming-Fish continue HUMMING down the hill past a fat Bar-Ba-Loot, named LOU, who stuffs his face with Truffula fruit. PIPSQUEAK a baby Bar-Ba-Loot sits next to him eating his own piece of fruit. Then a series of Bar-Ba-Loots jump onto Lou’s head and stand on one another’s shoulders to get to some fruit high in the tree. Pipsqueak is passed up the chair of Bar-Ba-Loots and he grabs the fruit for the group.

In the tuft above them, a SWOMEE-SWAN flies off into the sky, revealing a nest with BILL, a baby Swomee-Swan, in it. Bill YAWNS and HONKS at camera.
We follow the Swomee-Swan as it flies through the forest, past a stream and to a clear blue pond where--
The Trio of Humming-Fish climb out of the water onto a rock and HUM like an a cappella group. Then they slide back down into the water and their HUMMING becomes GURGLING.
Melvin pulls the wagon down into the valley, where all of the curious animals gather around them. The Once-ler hops down from the wagon with his guitar and starts begins rocking out.
ONCE-LER (CONT’D)
This is it!
Two Bar-Ba-Loots look at each other, confused.
ONCE-LER (CONT’D)
This is the place!
These Truffula Trees are just’a what I need!
The Bar-Ba-Loots hear him playing and come over to investigate.
ONCE-LER (CONT’D)
Gonna chop one down and make my Thneed.
But first--
THWACK! As he stands up he accidentally smacks a Bar-ba-loot with his guitar.
Then he tosses it up into the air and runs off screen. One Bar-Ba-Loot pushes another out of the way as the guitar falls back down to the ground and nearly clobbers him.
The Once-ler sings and dances through the valley, followed by the curious animals.
ONCE-LER (CONT’D)
Na na nanana na Na na nanana na
(to animals) Now you!
The animals, caught up in the music, join in singing and dancing with the Once-ler.

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 25.
ANIMALS
Na na nanana na
Nana na nana na na na!
Lou gets into it and doesn’t realize the other animals have danced off after the Once-ler. He opens his eyes and runs after them.
ONCE-LER That’s great!
(scats to the music)
ANIMALS
Na na nanana na
Nana na nana na na na! Bob-shoo-bop Bob-shoo-bop
He goes into the back of the wagon, pulls out a spatula, and sings into it like a microphone.
ONCE-LER
So now our friendship can begin. Hand-and-hand and wing and fin.
The Once-ler goes back into the wagon and begins unpacking, obliviously tossing tools over his head at the animals.
ONCE-LER (CONT’D)
There’s nothing you and I can’t do So let’s all make my dreams come true!
Yodelhoo...
Yodelay-hee-hoo...
A saw, shovel, pruning shears, and an axe land right in front of different animals, almost hitting them. Then a hair trimmer bounces past shaving the stomach of a Bar-Ba-Loot, who quickly covers up, embarrassed.
A tube of toothpaste lands in front of a Humming-Fish. Then a mallet lands on that, squirting the toothpaste all over his face.
A beard trimmer flies out and shaved one of the Bar-Ba-Loots. A tube of toothpaste explodes on another one.
ANIMALS
Na na nanana na
Nana na nana na na na! Na na nanana na
Nana na nana na na na!

The wagon unpacked, the oblivious Once-ler pulls out an axe and goes for the big finish.
ONCE-LER
Oh Yodelay-Yodelay-heee-hoooo--
Instead of jubilantly joining in the chorus, the angry mob of animals have all turned against the Once-ler.
One Swomee-Swan has a stick and taps it against his winged- palm menacingly.
LOU
Na na nanana na
Lou dances over and then notices that everyone else is angry and he stops singing.
ONCE-LER
Hey, guys. Come on! Where’s my
back up chorus?
The Bar-Ba-Loots GROWL at the Once-ler.
A Humming-Fish picks up a set of egg beaters and winds them menacingly.
EXT: TRUFFULA VALLEY - PAST - CONTINUOUS
The Once-ler turns back to his wagon and grabs TWO LARGE SACKS.
ONCE-LER
Then he realizes they are filled with marshmallows.
Ah-ha!
Oh!
ONCE-LER (CONT’D)
An Angry Bar-ba-loot lunges for him and the Once-ler screams like a girl, holding the sack up as a shield. RIIIIP! MARSHMALLOWS fly out into the air.
The marshmallow rain down into the angry animals’ mouths, who eat them. MMMMM! It’s like a switch has been flipped.
Ooooh!
ANIMALS
They all love marshmallows! All of the animals frolic and play in them.

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 27.
A Bar-Ba-Loot jumps through the air in slo-mo catching one in his mouth.
Down below, other Bar-Ba-Loots spin around grabbing as many in their mouths as they can. Humming-Fish eat ones floating in the water.
A Swomee-Swan drops Pipsqueak down into the pond, which is filled with them. A Humming Fish rides on a Bar-Ba-Loot through the marshmallows like a Gondolier.
The Once-ler looks down at Pipsqueak who has a huge smile, revealing dozens of marshmallows crammed in his mouth. Clearly he’s going for the record. The Once-ler looks down at him with a smile.
TED (O.S.) Hey-hey-hey-hey. Wait. Wait a
minute.
The Once-ler looks around to see where the voice is coming from.
EXT: LERKIM - PRESENT - NIGHT
Back to the Once-ler looking down at Ted from his Lerkim.
Beat.
Beat.
TED
Um, yeah, that’s awesome. You
know, feeding junk food to forest animals. That’s great. But, uh, is there a musical number where you show me how to get a tree? ‘Cause I’d love to hear that one.
ONCE-LER (O.S.)
Oh, yes. Right after the musical
number about the kid who kept interrupting the story and was never heard from again. Mm-hm.
TED Right, got it.
(gestures with hand) Proceed.
Excuse me?
ONCE-LER (O.S.)

EXT: TRUFFULA VALLEY - PAST - DAY
The Once-ler puts on a pair of work gloves and grabs a large AXE.
ONCE-LER
All right! Here we go. About to
make a Thneed. About to change the world.
The animals all stare at the shiny metal axe and watch the Once-ler as he walks over to the tall Truffula tree.
He raises the axe up over his head. The animals watch curiously.
CHOP! The axe cuts into the tree with a sound that echoes through the valley.
The tree creaks and moans as it falls and hits the ground with a THUD.
The animals react in horror. What did he just do? The Once-ler stares at the tree, impressed.
ONCE-LER (CONT’D) Check it out guys... Huh?
He looks around, noticing all of the animals are gone.
ONCE-LER (CONT’D) Oh, where’d everybody go?
He shrugs, then grabs the tree by the trunk and drags it away toward his cottage.
EXT: LERKIM - PRESENT - NIGHT The Once-ler continues the story.
ONCE-LER (O.S.)
Little did I know that by chopping
down that tree I had just summoned a mystical creature as old as time itself. The legendary--slightly annoying--guardian of the forest.
(beat) The Lorax.

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 29.
EXT. TRUFFULA VALLEY - PAST - DAY
The animals investigate the stump. A Humming-Fish pokes at it.
Suddenly the ground starts rumbling. The animals scatter.
There’s a LOUD NOISE and a FLASH OF LIGHT as a thunderstorm shoots out of the stump. The animals watch from a safe distance.
The one fish slaps the other fish for poking the stump.
The Swomee-Swans shove their head in the ground like ostriches. A Bar-Ba-Loot tries it and knocks himself out.
A series of lightning bolts hit the stump causing an explosion that reverberates through the valley.
Lou struggles to stand up in the wind. A fish flies into his face, knocking him over.
The whole thunderstorm is sucked back into the stump and out pops--
THE LORAX. Shortish, brownish, and in charge. He slowly stands up. Sees the stump, reacts horrified.
LORAX (in disbelief)
What the w-- Who the-- Oh!
The animals watch as he collects some ROCKS and stacks them on the stump, creating a memorial. Pipsqueak sees this. He brings over a rock and offers it to the Lorax. Other animals join him.
When they are done they take a moment of silence for the stump. Pipsqueak walks over and holds the Lorax’s hand. Lou awkwardly grabs the Lorax’s other hand and starts blubbering.
Then the Lorax hears the Once-ler WHISTLING and spots him ripping tufts from the Truffula tree. The Lorax furrows his brow and walks over to investigate.
The Once-ler shakes the tufts like pom-poms as he pulls them off the felled tree.
Then he pulls another piece of the tuft and the Lorax comes up with it.
Hey!
LORAX (CONT’D)

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 30.
The Once-ler is startled and trips, falling to the ground.
LORAX (CONT’D) (accusingly)
Did you chop down this tree? Pipsqueak curiously wanders over to them.
ONCE-LER
What? Uh... no. Who did it?
(gasps, points offscreen) What’s that?!
The Lorax looks away and Once-ler drops the axe onto Pipsqueak.
Oy!
PIPSQUEAK
ONCE-LER I think he did it.
The Lorax isn’t buying it.
LORAX
Leave! Vacate the premises! Take
your axe and get out! The Once-ler stares at the Lorax.
ONCE-LER And who are you?
The Once-ler pokes the Lorax in the belly.
LORAX
What-- what?!! I’m-- I’m the
Lorax!
(off Once-ler’s blank
look)
Guardian of the forest. I speak for the trees.
(still blank)
So you’re telling me you just didn’t see me magically appear out of that stump? With all the lightning and thunder and stuff? You didn’t see any of that?
ONCE-LER
No. But that sounds amazing. Can
I see some of that?

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 31.
LORAX
Uh... yeah, I could show you. But
that’s not how it works.
ONCE-LER (condescending)
Okay, um... Didn’t really happen. (beat)
Oh, I know what you want! (pokes Lorax’s nose)
He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a MARSHMALLOW. Holds it out.
ONCE-LER (CONT’D) (baby talk)
I’ve got one of these for the cutest little guy I ever saw. Yummy-yummy-yummy...
The Lorax stares at the marshmallow.
LORAX
How dare you! Give me that!
He grabs the marshmallow. Sniffs it. It smells good.
LORAX (CONT’D)
Hmmm... I’m going to eat this, but
I am highly offended by it.
He plops it into his mouth. Then makes his way over to the Once-ler’s tent-house which is being supported by stakes and ropes. Kick out a STAKE. The canvas starts to sag.
ONCE-LER
Whoa, what are you-- What?! Hey,
mustache! Will you stop that!
The Lorax continues circling around the tent-house pulling up stakes. The Once-ler grabs his HAMMER and follows, pounding them back in.
ONCE-LER (CONT’D) What’s your deal, man?!
LORAX
Time for you to go, beanpole!
They circle faster and faster around the tent-house, the Lorax pulling up stakes and the Once-ler pounding them back in.

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 32.
ONCE-LER
Pull ’em right out and I’m just
gonna put ’em right back in. I can do this all day. Unbelievable.
Until the Once-ler turns a corner and is about to bring his hammer down on--
Pipsqueak. The Lorax has placed him right where the stake would have been. The Lorax holds up his hand to stop the Once-ler.
LORAX
Whoa! Stop right there! Stop it!
So you’d hammer one of nature’s innocent creatures?
The Lorax pats Pipsqueak on the head and he happily runs offscreen.
ONCE-LER (horrified)
What?! No, I would never hit this little guy. You, on the other hand, I would gladly pound you and your mustache into the ground.
The Lorax turns to all of the watching animals.
LORAX
Behold the intruder and his violent
ways!
(to the Once-ler)
Shame on you. For shame.
The Once-ler drops the hammer and hides it behind his feet. Then he sees all of the animals nodding their heads in agreement.
The Once-ler’s had it.
ONCE-LER
All right, you know what, that’s
it.
(points at Lorax)
You listen to me, you furry meatloaf. I’m gonna chop down as many trees as I need. Okay, news flash, not going anywhere. End of story!
He turns and enters his cottage. His sticks his tongue out and does RASPBERRIES to the Lorax before slamming the door behind him.

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 33.
INT: ONCE-LER’S COTTAGE - PAST - CONTINUOUS The Once-ler sighs heavily, shaking his head.
LORAX (O.S.)
Then you leave me no choice.
Startled, the Once-ler turns and sees that the Lorax is somehow inside with him. He points a threatening finger at the Once-ler and speaks in a spooky voice as if he’s casting a spell.
LORAX (CONT’D)
If you’re not gone by the time the
sun sets on this valley, all the forces of nature will be unleashed upon you and curse you until the end of your days!
(beat)
You have been warned.
Lorax turns to make a dramatic exit, but can’t reach the doorknob of Once-ler’s door. He hops a couple of times.
Finally, the Once-ler lets him out.
Then:
LORAX (CONT’D)
Thanks. Yeah, okay.
LORAX
You have been warned!
ONCE-LER
The Lorax storms out and slams the door, leaving the Once-ler alone in his cottage.
EXT: LERKIM - PRESENT - NIGHT
Back to the Once-ler looking down at Ted from his Lerkim. Ted is clearly entranced by the story.
ONCE-LER (O.S.)
But I didn’t listen to his warning.
And you won’t believe what happened that night...
TED What?

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 34. Beat.
ONCE-LER (O.S.)
If you want to hear more, come back
tomorrow.
TED
Hey, wait, wait! Tomorrow?
The Whisper-Ma-Phone gets pulled back up. Ted leaps up and grabs it, getting carried up.
Whooooa!
TED (CONT’D)
The Whisper-Ma-Phone retracts into the shutters. Ted is flipped up into a bucket hanging near the window.
TED (CONT’D)
Are you serious right now? Ugh!
You live in the middle of nowhere! It stinks out here! Don’t make me come back.
ONCE-LER (O.S.)
Then I guess you don’t really want
to hear the rest of the story.
Once-ler quickly drops the bucket down, and Ted with it. The bucket stops right before the ground and the claw comes down and knocks Ted out of it. Ted gets back up and shouts up to the Once-ler.
TED
No, no, no, no, I do. I really do.
I wanna hear the story, I just--
ONCE-LER (O.S.)
Nah! You don’t have what it takes.
Goodbye!
His green arms leave the window. Ted realizes he’s pushed too much, and does an about-face.
TED
Wait, wait, wait! I have what it
takes. It’s alright. It’s okay. I’ll come back. It’s no problem!
Ted turns and quickly heads down the path back to his scooter.

WOMAN (O.S.) What’d you wish for, Audrey?
Audrey smiles.
AUDREY
Well, I’d love to tell you, but
sadly, according to the universal wish laws, I cannot.
TED (O.S.)
Oh, I know what she wished for.
Audrey turns and sees Ted playing the piano on a balcony above. In a TUXEDO. He hops onto the railing of a spiral staircase and slides down to the first floor, where he continues sliding past a WAITER who holds a tray with an milkshake. Ted grabs it as he continues sliding to a TALL OBJECT covered with a VELVET CLOTH.
TED (CONT’D) Was it perhaps...
(takes a sip from the shake)
Uh--this?
He removes the velvet cloth, revealing a POTTED TRUFFULA TREE. The party erupts in CHEERS and APPLAUSE and FLASHBULBS POP. Audrey can’t believe her eyes.

Oh man...
Mom is also getting frustrated.
TED’S MOM (to Grammy Norma)
Mom, seriously--every turn?
GRAMMY NORMA Hey, back off!

She heads upstairs to her room. As soon as she’s gone Ted turns to see Grammy’s face right next to his.
TED Whoa!
GRAMMY NORMA
I knew I could break her. Go.
Ted’s confused. Grammy Norma gestures to the door.

And he runs out the door.
EXT: THNEEDVILLE - PRESENT - DAY
Ted rides his scooter through the street on his way back to the door out of town.
EXT: ALLEY - PRESENT - CONTINUOUS
Ted turns into an alley and runs into someone. He falls off his scooter. He looks up at Mooney and McGurk. Mooney sips from a tiny O’Hare Air can and then crushes it with his fingers. They step aside revealing, Aloysius O’Hare, who uses their hands to walk down to the ground from his car.
O’HARE Hey, Ted, right?
He signs a document and then sticks his pen in the palm of Mooney’s hand. Mooney GROANS.
TED
(a bit creeped out)
Uh... Mr. O’Hare.
O’Hare gives Mooney and McGurk a look. They close like automatic doors, completely sealing off the alleyway. O’Hare puts a hand on Ted’s shoulder.

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 39.
O’HARE
So I hear you’ve become interested
in trees. What’s that all about?
TED
(chuckles nervously)
Oh, um... Where’d you hear that? O’Hare smiles.
O’HARE
Oh, Teddy, there’s not much that
goes on in Thneedville that I don’t know about.
(beat)
Here’s the deal. I make a living selling fresh air to people.
Trees, oh, they make it for free. So when I hear people talking about them, I consider it kind of a threat to my business.
(growls)
TED
C’mon, I don’t even know what
you’re talking about, I... O’Hare, furious, gets right in Ted’s face.
O’HARE
Listen to me, boy. Don’t go poking
around in things you don’t understand. Or I’ll be your worst nightmare! I’m Frankenstein’s head on a spider’s body!
Ted nods, trying not to freak out.
TED
Yeah, um, okay... my mom’s
expecting me so I’m just gonna--
O’HARE (chuckles)
Of course, of course, now go back to your family game time. Grandma just finished her turn.
TED
How-- How did you know?
O’HARE
Please. I have eyes everywhere.

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 40.
Mounted security cameras turn to face Ted. The eyes of a BABY IN A BILLBOARD move to look at him. A ROBOT CAT turns its head 180 degrees to stare at him.
O’HARE (CONT’D)
You got a beautiful town here, Ted.
Lots of fun stuff to occupy your short attention span. Why I can’t think of any reason you’d ever want to go outside of town again. Ever.
O’Hare gestures to Mooney and McGurk, who menacingly straighten the kinked neck of Ted’s scooter and slap Ted’s helmet on his head. They open up the alley exit. Ted quickly scooters away.
O’HARE (CONT’D) (calls after him)
Okay! Good talk! Really good talk.
The three of them get into O’Hare’s car.
Ted waits around the corner for the car to leave. He gets a determined look on his face, turns around, and scooters toward the end of town.

Ted arrives out of breath. Runs up to the door and RINGS the doorbell. This starts to set off the giant hammer again. Ted’s face falls. He forgot.

TED (CONT’D)
Look out!
Then calls up to the window.

TED
No I didn’t. I just-- I’m here to
hear the end of the story.
ONCE-LER (O.S.)
Why are you so interested in trees,
anyway? Why aren’t you like other kids, break-dancing and wearing bell-bottoms and playing the Donkey Kongs?
Ted reacts--”break-dancing”? “Donkey Kong”?
TED (playing it off)
Yeah, right, right... Yeah, I don’t know, I just-- I just, you know, thought it would be kinda cool to have one, you know.
ONCE-LER (O.S.) Ahhh...It’s a girl, isn’t it?
TED Pffft!
(laughs) What? No!
ONCE-LER (O.S.) Really? ‘Cause when a guy does
something stupid once, well, that’s because he’s a guy. But if he does the same stupid thing twice, it’s usually to impress some girl.
TED
Hey, she is not “some girl.” She’s
a woman. In high school. And she loves trees and I’m going to get her one.
The Once-ler’s yellow eyes stare down from the window, almost seeming to smile.

CREEEEAK! The sleeping Once-ler doesn’t wake at the sound of the door slowly opening. Then the faint sound of tiny footsteps can be heard shuffling across the floor.
The Once-ler’s bed raises up off the ground several inches and begins to move toward the door.
Lou backs into the stove and burns himself.
It’s almost to the door when we hear a THUD!
Several animals struggle to carry the Once-ler’s bed.
They reach the front door of the house -- the bed won’t fit. BANG BANG BANG!

Melvin sees this and WHINNIES. The Lorax approaches him with some Truffula fruit. Melvin takes it as payment to keep quiet.
EXT: TRUFFULA VALLEY - PAST - NIGHT
Under the pale moonlight, we see THREE HUMMING-FISH humming the MISSION IMPOSSIBLE THEME. Then the silhouettes of the Lorax and several other animals tiptoe as they carry the Once- ler’s bed from his home, down the hill toward a flowing
river. Lou runs after them, huffing and puffing, trying to keep up.

The Lorax and the animals come to a halt at the edge of the river. The Lorax smiles as he addresses his accomplices.
LORAX (whispering)
Okay, nice and easy.
The Lorax and the animals quietly slip the bed into the river and watch as it calmly floats downstream. The Lorax turns to the animals, beaming.
LORAX (CONT’D)
Nice work, you guys. Couldn’t’ve
done it without you.
He turns and waves to the Once-ler as he floats away. The Lorax’s face falls as he sees Pipsqueak waving back at him, sitting on top of the sleeping Once-ler and floating downstream.

You gotta to be kidding me. Can he
swim?

Hang on, Pipsqueak! I’m coming to getcha!
The Lorax and animals take off running along side the floating bed. Lou rolls his eyes and runs after them.

They swim up to the bed and try to pull it over to the side, but the blanket and top sheet rips off, covering them.
Oh!

Still sleeping, the Once-ler shivers and grabs Pipsqueak and uses him like a blanket.
The Lorax points to a LOW-HANGING BRANCH. He directs the animals up the tree.
LORAX (CONT’D)
Jump! Jump! C’mon get up there!
C’mon! Go go! Little bit more! Little bit more!
The branch doesn’t hang low enough.
LORAX (CONT’D) Ugh! Now what?
Lorax looks over to see Lou standing next to him stuffing his face with fruit.
The Lorax struggles to push Lou up the tree.
LORAX (CONT’D) C’mon! Get up there! Whoa!
The branch hangs low enough to reach Pipsqueak. Pipsqueak sees the Lorax and Bar-Ba-Loots hanging from the branch trying to save him. The Lorax stretches out his hand...
LORAX (CONT’D)
Okay, Pipsqueak, give me your hand.
C’mon, reach out for the Lorax.
...but Pipsqueak grabs FRUIT hanging from the tree instead and takes a big bite.

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 45.
LORAX (CONT’D) Where’d you go?
(slaps his forehead)
What are you?! Bar-Ba-Loots...
The Once-ler’s foot now drops into the water. Like a rudder, it re-directs the bed to a side stream. The Lorax’s face falls.
LORAX (CONT’D) Oh, that’s bad.
The bed passes by the Three Humming-Fish standing on a lily pad who are HUMMING “TAPS”.
Suddenly, Pipsqueak whimpers and a look of terror comes over his face as he looks downstream and sees rapids approaching.
LORAX (CONT’D) Hey, Beanpole! Wake up!
Pipsqueak runs to the end of the bed, which flips upside down in the water. Then it flips right side up again. The Once- ler is covered in fish who quickly jump back off the bed and into the water.
The Once-ler wakes up, spitting water out of his mouth. He looks at Pipsqueak holding onto the bed frame and waving to him. Pipsqueak CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY.
ONCE-LER
Uh, what’s happening? Where is--
Where am I?
Then he sees the Lorax running alongside him on the shore. His face falls.
The Lorax points to the rapids ahead.
LORAX
Hey, you got trouble and it’s
coming up fast!
The Once-ler turns and sees the approaching rapids.
ONCE-LER Aaah! We’re in a river!
The river is picking up speed. Pipsqueak and the Once-ler hold on for dear life as the bed hits the whitewater and bobs up and down.
ONCE-LER AND PIPSQUEAK Whhhhhhoooooooaaaaa!

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 46.
Finally the whitewater ends. The Once-ler and Pipsqueak breathe sighs of relief. They LAUGH at the fact that they survived and then see the waterfall ahead of them.
Ewww...
Oh no.
PIPSQUEAK
ONCE-LER
He and Pipsqueak SCREAM in fear. The Once-ler unsuccessfully tries to use his pillow to paddle away from the waterfall.
He calls to the Lorax.
ONCE-LER (CONT’D) Just do something!
The Lorax looks around. Spots a GIANT BOULDER up high above the waterfall.
LORAX Help is on the way!
The bed heads closer and closer to the falls.
ONCE-LER (mutters to himself)
What the-- Oh no!
The Lorax quickly scampers up to the boulder with a STICK. Wedges the stick under the boulder. Tries to dislodge it.
LORAX Just a minute!
He jumps up and down on the stick. The boulder gets dislodged and rolls down the hill.
At the end of the hill is a small slope going up, which send the boulder flying.
The Once-ler and Pipsqueak, about to go over the waterfall, now see a giant boulder flying at them.
ONCE-LER AND PIPSQUEAK Aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!
THUMP! The boulder connects with the far side of the bed, catapulting the Once-ler and Pipsqueak off of it.
The bed crashes over the falls. Violently.

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 47.
THUD! The Once-ler bounces and slides along the ground on his back, holding Pipsqueak up in the air, so he wouldn’t get hurt.
Huh.
PIPSQUEAK
Pipsqueak looks over to the Lorax who appears on the scene, seeing the Once-ler lying unconscious. His eyes go wide.
LORAX Oooo! Oh no...
(slaps the Once-ler) Wake up! Wake up!
The Lorax knows what he needs to do, but doesn’t want to do it.
The animals watch as the Lorax pinches the Once-ler’s nose and tips his head back. He takes a deep breath and lowers his lips to the Once-ler’s.
The Lorax comes up and wipes off his tongue. That didn’t work, so he grabs two Bar-Ba-Loots, rubbing them together to create a static charge that he uses to shock the Once-ler.
Clear!
LORAX (CONT’D)
The Lorax jumps back as the Once-ler wakes up. He immediately reaches out and hugs the Lorax.
ONCE-LER
Haha! I was heading into the light
and you pulled me right back and here I am! You saved my life!
The Lorax squirms guiltily as the Once-ler hugs him.
LORAX
Yeah, no...I know. Well, no, it’s
not that big a deal.
ONCE-LER
It is a big deal! Look, I almost
went over that waterfall-- (breaks off hug,
realizing)
In my bed... How did my bed get in the river?
The Lorax avoids eye contact with the Once-ler.

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 48.
LORAX
Oh, about that, actually...
um...I...
(under his breath)
Putyourbedinthewater. The Once-ler drops the Lorax.
LORAX (CONT’D)
I didn’t mean you any harm! I just
wanted to calmly float you away. (beat)
Look, everyone here needs the trees. And you’re chopping ‘em down. So we’ve got a big problem.
The Once-ler looks down and sees Pipsqueak holding on to his leg, looking up at him with puppy-dog eyes. Pipsqueak nods. The Once-ler looks at all the animals. The Lorax. Finally, it begins to sink in. He kneels down and address the animals.
ONCE-LER (holds up his hand to
swear)
Alright, look, I hereby swear that I will never chop down another tree. I promise!
The Lorax looks him over.
LORAX
Thank you. But I’m gonna keep my
eye on you.
ONCE-LER
Good. Now, I’ve got a big day
tomorrow, so I’m going to get some sleep.
The Once-ler heads off toward his house. The animals all CHEER. The Once-ler stops and walks back toward the falls.
ONCE-LER (CONT’D) Right after I find my bed.
The other Baby Bar-Ba-Loot touches a fish next to him, shocking it.

INT: ONCE-LER’S COTTAGE - PAST - SAME
The Once-ler wakes up from a good night’s sleep. Then turns and finds--
The Lorax. Lying next to him in the bed, SNORING. He SCREAMS.
ONCE-LER Aaaaiiiigggghhhhh!
This wakes up the Lorax.
LORAX Aaaiiiiggghhhhh!
ONCE-LER AND LORAX Aaaiiiiggghhhhhh!!!
Lorax punches the Once-ler.
ONCE-LER
Ow. Okay, uh... What are you, I-I--
The Once-ler looks around. He turns to the Lorax.
ONCE-LER (CONT’D) Question... what are they doing
here?
We reveal his place is filled with animals. Bar-ba-loots curled up at the foot of his bed, Swomee-Swans nesting in light fixtures, and Humming-fish in drawers. A sleeping Bar- Ba-Loot SNEEZES, knocking the Baby Bar-Ba-Loot on it’s stomache onto the ground.
ONCE-LER (CONT’D) (beat)
And follow up, if I may, what are YOU doing here?!
LORAX
Well, after ”the incident” last
night we found one of your socks and came here to return it. But when we got here, you were asleep.
 
Dr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 50. Something drops on the Once-ler’s head.
What?
ONCE-LER
He looks up to see it’s drool from a Bar-Ba-Loot sleeping on his lamp.
ONCE-LER (CONT’D)
Ew, exactly. And sleeping is the
body’s way of telling other people to go away.
LORAX
I know, but you looked so cozy...
and it was cold outside... and we just fell asleep. No harm done.
The Once-ler jumps up out of his bed, flustered.
ONCE-LER
No harm done? No harm done???
(sighs) Okay...
Then he turns to the counter and sees several fish sitting in drinking glasses of water, like jacuzzis.
ONCE-LER (CONT’D)
Oh, okay, I put my lips on those.
Well, I used to anyway.
Then he sees a Swomee-Swan nesting in a large bowl on the counter top. The bird SQUAWKS loudly, then stands up, revealing a FRESHLY-LAID EGG.
Ewww!
ONCE-LER (CONT’D)
The animals all applaud, proud of her. She high fives another Swomee-Swan. The Once-ler is disgusted.
ONCE-LER (CONT’D) Did you just...in my bowl?!
The Once-ler grits his teeth.
The Lorax’s hand grabs the Once-ler’s TOOTHBRUSH out of a glass. He enters the kitchen combing his moustache with the TOOTHBRUSH.
LORAX
Why do you have one of these?

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 51.
He holds it up--it’s filled with yellow LORAX HAIR.
LORAX (CONT’D)
You don’t even have a moustache.
He hands it to the Once-ler and heads for the fridge. The Once-ler follows him, tossing the toothbrush in the trash.
ONCE-LER Okay, that’s it!
LORAX
What? I thought we made a deal
last night.
ONCE-LER
Yes, we did! And I said I wouldn’t
chop down anymore trees.
LORAX
And I said I was going to keep an
eye on you.
(turns to fridge)
I’m starvin’, what’s for breakfast?
The Lorax opens the refrigerator, revealing Lou with his cheeks stuffed full with everything in the fridge. He looks out at the Lorax and Once-ler. Busted. Then he shoves the last remaining item into his mouth. An entire STICK OF BUTTER. The Lorax closes the fridge.
LORAX (CONT’D) Breakfast is overrated.
The Once-ler looks like he is about to explode, but stops. Takes a deep breath and puts his hands in the air.
ONCE-LER
You know what? I got work to do.
Yup! I gotta go into town and sell my Thneed!
The Once-ler holds up the Thneed. The Lorax stares at it.
LORAX (laughs)
Oh! You chopped down one of my trees to make that piece of garbage? Just look at that--
ONCE-LER
Garbage? Oh, no. OH, NO! You do
not get it. (MORE)

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 52.
ONCE-LER (CONT'D) This is a revolutionary product
that will change the world as we know it!
The Once-ler walks over to the Bar-ba-loots sleeping on the table and brushes them all off.
ONCE-LER (CONT’D) It has a million uses!
He reaches under the table and pulls up Lou who is now wearing the Thneed as underwear.
ONCE-LER (CONT’D) Look at this! It’s a swimsuit!
Hup-hey-oh!
Then he points to the muddy animal tracks on the floor.
ONCE-LER (CONT’D)
Mud tracked all over your floor by
uninvited guests? Well, the Thneed sure comes in handy for that! Wup- adup-apoh!
The Once-ler uses it to wipe up the mud tracks.
ONCE-LER (CONT’D)
But wait, there’s more! Thanks to
its all-natural micro-fibers, the Thneed is super-absorbent!
Then he goes to the fish swimming a glass filled with water. Shoves the Thneed into the glass. SLUUUURP! It instantly soaks up all the water, leaving the irritated fish standing in the dry glass.
ONCE-LER (CONT’D) It also works as a hat!
He plops the Thneed onto Lorax’s head. SPLURCH! It’s sopping wet and drips all over him. The Lorax gives the Once- ler a look.
ONCE-LER (CONT’D)
Of course, you’d probably want to
wring it out first, eh--
The Lorax takes the Thneed off his head and throws it at the Once-ler.

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 53.
LORAX
Go ahead, go ahead! Knock yourself
out. But nobody’s gonna buy that thing!
ONCE-LER
Good to know. Well fortunately
you’re not the target market. Weirdo.
Once-ler strums his guitar.
LORAX
You’re bringing a guitar?
ONCE-LER
Oh, yeah. Oh, I got a little
jingle, gonna blow some minds. Gonna sell some Thneeds!
He holds up the Thneed defiantly.
Yeah...

ONCE-LER (O.S.) That one hit the tender spot.
The Once-ler wipes the tomatoes off his face with the Thneed.
ONCE-LER (V.O.) Until finally...
ONCE-LER
That’s it! You know what? I’m--
I’m done with this thing.
The crowd, waiting for their tomatoes, react disappointedly.
CROWD Awwwwwww...
The Once-ler walks around the corner.

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 55.
ONCE-LER
My family was right! I quit!
He takes the Thneed off from around his neck and tosses it over his shoulder where it lands on the head of a GEEKY TEENAGE GIRL, knocking off her glasses and causing her long hair to unfurl. As she struggles to get it off it becomes a hat. She is about to take it off when a COOL GUY passes by.
COOL GUY Hey, cool hat.
Some other TEENAGE GIRLS notice this. Approach the Geeky Teenage Girl.
OTHER TEEN GIRL
Oh my gosh, I totally want one.

Suddenly everyone in the park notices the Geeky Teenage Girl and her Thneed. She smiles at all the attention.

LORAX (CONT’D)
Hey, where’s your Thneed? Did you
sell it?
ONCE-LER
Hey, yeah, no, ah, no. No, didn’t
sell it. Turns out it’s ahead of its time, I guess.

Pipsqueak is his sous-chef who catches the pancakes on a plate. The Once-ler takes the plate from him and pats him on the head.
ONCE-LER (CONT’D) Who is up for ninths?
The animals are stuffed. Including one INCREDIBLY FAT HUMMING-FISH. Lou frantically waves his hand.

ONCE-LER
Aww, yeah! We’re in business,

The Lorax frowns. Pipsqueak obliviously dances along with the music. Clearly not happy about this.

Chet drops the bear and runs over to the RV. Brett runs after him, stepping on the fallen Bar-Ba-Loot.
Chet is about to push a button on the side of the RV, but Brett shoves him out of the way and pushes it.
The RV comes to life. It digs posts into the ground and begins expanding. A swing, a TV, a line of laundry, and a satellite dish pop out. A Swomee-Swan flies right into the satellite dish.

Thneeds fast enough.
Uncle Ubb walks by, pushing a large cart full of harvested Truffula tufts.
UNCLE UBB Harvesting the tufts takes too
long.
Once-ler looks out the window and sees Brett slowly pick a tuft with mechanical gloves at the end of long lazy tongs. Then he hands it to Chet who walks all the way over to the cart. It’s clearly the least efficient way to work.
The Once-ler turns to his Mom.
ONCE-LER
Well what else can we do?
ONCE-LER’S MOM Well...and this just came to
me...we could always start chopping down the trees.
Once-ler bolts upright.

Ted, Audrey and Grammy race through the neighborhood on Ted’s scooter (Audrey holding on to Ted and Grammy Norma in the back). Audrey sees the shadow of O’Hare’s blimp rising over them.
AUDREY
Ted, Ted! Big scary blimp coming!
Ted sees the blimp catching up to them.
O’Hare LAUGHS as he locks a strap around his waist. McGurk fires up a rocket pack helmet and dives off the blimp towards Ted’s scooter. We reveal O’Hare strapped to his chest like a baby bjorn. He holds a bull horn in his hands.
O’HARE
You won’t get away with this, boy!
Bam!
O’Hare and McGurk weave in and out of traffic past the fun cars we saw in Thneedville. They get stuck behind a Man riding a very tall scooter. O’Hare calls to him on the megaphone.
O’HARE (CONT’D) Go faster, you idiot!
McGurk slaps the Man out of the way as they take off after Ted.
GRAMMY NORMA Step on it, Ted!
Ted makes a hard turn. Mooney drives out of a tunnel towards them and Ted makes an evasive maneuver around the tunnel wall, narrowly avoiding him.
McGurk and O’Hare turn the corner, heading towards Mooney’s truck.

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 89.
O’HARE Whaaa!
SLAM! McGurk and O’Hare slam into Mooney’s windshield and slide off like squashed bugs.
MOONEY Oooh...
O’HARE (squashed against the
windshield) You’re fired!
Grammy Norma LAUGHS as she think they’ve escaped, but O’Hare gets up and takes chase on foot.
GRAMMY NORMA Whoa, Ted, look out!
Ted turns back around and sees he’s gone off the road. And is heading right towards an OPEN ELEVATOR leading to the KITE PARK.
TED Whoa!
People in the elevator SCREAM. SCREEECH! Ted slams on the brakes. The scooter spins and comes to a gentle stop inside the elevator next to a LITTLE BOY holding a kite.
They look outside the elevator and see O’Hare and his goons running toward them.
Ted...
AUDREY
Ted, panicking, presses the “CLOSE DOORS” button repeatedly. O’Hare and his goons are getting closer.
O’HARE Nobody beats--!
The doors close just in the nick of time. DING.
Dammit!
O’HARE (CONT’D)
INT: ELEVATOR - PRESENT - CONTINUOUS
Everyone on the elevator stars awkwardly at Ted, Audrey, and Grammy Norma.

EXT: KITE PARK - PRESENT - CONTINUOUS
DING! The elevator doors open, and they speed out into the Kite Park, which is at the top of Thneedville’s tallest building.
Ted weaves in and out of the KIDS flying kites powered by GIANT FANS. They stop at the edge of the building.
TED
Not good! How’s it doing?
Audrey looks down at the seed and O’Hare spots it from down in the street with his binoculars. McGurk gives him a gun that shoots metal pinchers. He fires it at Audrey, but misses the seed and grabs onto one of the giant fans behind them.
GRAMMY NORMA (laughs)
Loser!
O’HARE Oh, really?
O’Hare tugs the line redirecting the fan toward them.
WHOOOOOSH! The power of the fans BLOWS the seed right out of Audrey’s hand!
TED Hey!
AUDREY Oh no. The seed!
The three of them watch helplessly as the seed flies up in the air.
From the ground, O’Hare spies it with his binoculars.
O’HARE (to his goons)
Get that seed!
McGurk goes after it on his scooter as O’Hare hops in the sidecar.
Up above, Ted sees this and revs up his scooter.
TED
Hang on! Here we go!

He rides off the edge of the roof, landing in the snow of the ski slope below. SWOOOSH! Grammy falls off.
Grammy!
TED (CONT’D)
Grammy Norma pushes a GUY off his snowboard and borrows it to catch up with Ted’s scooter.
She gets her legs and starts to have fun.
AUDREY
Oh, wow! Seriously?! How cool is
your Gramma?!
She blows a kiss to a SKIER, who does a double take, not watching where he’s going. The Skier slams right into a fake fir tree.
Ted watches as the seed continues falling past the ski slopes toward the ground.
TED No!
Grammy Norma pulls to a stop at the bottom and Ted catches up with her.
C’mon!
TED (CONT’D)
EXT: STREET - PRESENT - SAME
Down below in the street, O’Hare spots it with his binoculars.
O’HARE There it is!
The seed floats down and lands right inside the empty air bottle.
The O’Hare Delivery Man goes to pick up the bottle, but sees O’Hare’s trucks coming right at him and runs away.
O’HARE (CONT’D)
Hey, hey, hey! Watch the road, you
meathead!
Still looking through the binoculars while driving, Mooney accidentally crashes his truck into the building.
And all of the EMPTY AIR BOTTLES in the back spill out!
 
Dr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 92.
There must be hundreds of them. They all begin ROLLING down the hilly street, sweeping the bottle with the seed in it up with them. It’s an awesome sight as they all roll and bounce down the hill. The bottles smack O’Hare in the face and the one with the seed bounces by before he can grab it.
O’HARE (CONT’D) Hey, ow-ow-ow! Oh! C’mon!
McGurk turns the scooter around and goes after it.
Just then, Ted’s scooter approaches at the bottom of the hill.
O’Hare catches up to the bottle with the seed and grabs it, LAUGHING in victory. But his hand gets stuck and he can’t reach the seed.
O’HARE (CONT’D) What the--?!
He holds out his arm to Mooney in the other truck.
O’HARE (CONT’D)
Get it unstuck! Get it unstuck!
Ted drives toward him playing chicken.
O’HARE (CONT’D)
Bring it on, Teddy! You don’t have
the guts! Grammy SCREAMS.
Ted!
AUDREY
At the last second, Ted leans the scooter over and skids underneath O’Hare and the bottle. It goes into slo-mo.
TED (in slo-mo)
Grammy!
Grammy hooks the bottle with her cane and yanks it away from O’Hare.
Ted rights the bike and the scene goes back to normal speed.
TED & AUDREY & GRAMMY Yeah! Yes! Wahoo!
McGurk is distracted and they head right toward the two Marketing Guys sharing a milkshake at an outdoor cafe.

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 93.
O’HARE Hey, hey, hey!
MARKETING GUYS (in unison)
Hey, it’s Mr. O--! SMASH! Ted speeds away.
GRAMMY NORMA Take that shorty!
EXT. TOWN SQUARE - PRESENT - CONTINUOUS
Ted drives up onto the curb and screeches to a halt right in the center of town by the STATUE OF O’HARE. Ted, Audrey and Grammy Norma quickly get off the scooter. Grammy Norma hits her cane against the ground, but it’s paved over.
TED
Okay, we have to get this in the
ground.
AUDREY
But where? There’s no dirt
anywhere!
Ooh!
GRAMMY NORMA
Grammy Norma smiles and scampers over to the BULLDOZER parked by the “COMING SOON! ANOTHER PARKING LOT!” construction site. Climbs into the cab.
TED No, um, Grammy...
BA-RUUUUMMMBLE! She fires up the bulldozer and starts pulling levers. The bulldozer growls like a dinosaur and immediately begins spinning out of control. VRRRRUUUUMBL!
Whoopsy!
GRAMMY NORMA
She pulls another lever and the bulldozer arm swings around and severs the head off the O’HARE STATUE. The head falls to the ground, cracking open the pavement and revealing--
A PATCH OF DIRT.
The bulldozer stops. Grammy Norma climbs down to join them.

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 94.
GRAMMY NORMA (CONT’D) See? What’d I tell you? Easy.
Huh?
Hey!
WOMAN (O.S.)
Then they turn to find dozens of townspeople have gathered to see what the commotion is.
WOMAN (CONT’D) They broke O’Hare’s head!
ANOTHER WOMAN
What do you think you’re doing,
kid?
Ted stares at the crowd. Busted.
TED
Um...I’m...I’m looking for a place
to plant a tree. A real one.
WOMAN
Why would we need a tree?
Exactly.
O’HARE (O.S.)
Everyone turns and sees O’Hare leaning on his broken statue’s head. All eyes are on him. Ted cringes.
TED (to himself)
Oh, man.
O’Hare addresses people in the crowd individually like a politician.
O’HARE
Folks, the last thing you want
around here is trees. They’re filthy, spewing that sticky, nasty sap all over the place.
(to Marie)
They bring poisonous ants and stinging bees.
He sticks his finger into Marie’s ice cream cone. Then licks it off.
Hey!
MARIE

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 95.
O’HARE
Ouch.
(to the Marie’s Mom)
Think about the kids. Marie runs to her Mom, scared.
O’HARE (CONT’D) (to a Maintenance Worker)
And... I just thought of, you know, they make leaves! I mean, you know that right?! And these leaves they just fall. They just fall where ever they want.
The Crowd GASPS. A MAN in the Crowd faints.
The crowd murmurs, concerned. The tide is definitely against Ted.
AUDREY (to the crowd)
Oh COME ON! We know why you’re REALLY against trees! Because they produce fresh air!
O’Hare frowns.
TED
(to the crowd)
For free!
The crowd starts murmuring at this.
O’HARE (gasps)
I am wounded! You have lied!
AUDREY
It is not a lie! It’s called
photosynthesis!
O’HARE
Oh, come on! She’s making that up!
That’s a made up word, people! Thneedville is perfect just the way it is. We don’t need trees!
(points accusingly at Ted) That boy has a seed! We need to stop him! Who’s with me? C’mon!
MAN O’Hare’s right!

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 96.
MARKETING GUY #2 Seeds will ruin us all!
CROWD
Stop it! Yeah! I’m afraid of
bees! Grab him!
O’Hare moves menacingly toward Ted, the crowd following him.
O’HARE
Last chance, kid. Hand it over.
Audrey turns to Ted. What do we do now? Ted gets an idea. Quickly hops up onto the bulldozer.
O’HARE (CONT’D)
Where do you think you’re going?
TED
(to Grammy and Audrey)
C’mon, let’s go. Get in. Get in!
They join him in the bulldozer’s cab. He hands Audrey the seed and puts the bulldozer in gear and drives away.
O’HARE Stop that maniac!
Ted HONKS the HORN and O’Hare runs out of the way.
TED
Excuse me! Excuse me! Watch out!
The bulldozer drives out of Town Square and O’Hare runs after them. The crowd follows. Ted heads straight for the wall surrounding the town.
AUDREY
Ted, you’re gonna hit the wall!
TED Yeah, I know.
SMASH!!! The bulldozer connects with the wall.
Then...CRACK. A line appears in the wall. It grows...and expands...until finally a huge section of it CRUMBLES to the ground. Revealing the desolate landscape outside. Everyone stares in stunned silence. O’Hare tries take the focus off the landscape.
O’HARE
Wow! Did you see that? Who does
this kid think he is? Huh?

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 97.
Ted leaps onto the top of the bulldozer.
TED
I am Ted Wiggins.
(beat)
And I speak for the trees.
(beat)
And the fact is things aren’t perfect here in Thneedville. And they’re only going to get worse unless we do something about it. Unless we change our ways. And we can start by planting this!
Ted holds up the seed. The crowd GASPS IN AWE as the little sprout opens up, revealing the first signs of a tuft. O’Hare grimaces. Addresses the crowd.
O’HARE
Okay, come on now, everything’s
fine. Right? I say we tell this kid what we think about that seed! People, c’mon!
The crowd doesn’t know what to do. O’Hare pulls the Singing Delivery Man aside.
O’HARE (CONT’D)
You! Get out there right now and
get these people on my side! Or else you’re fired!
(so crowd can here)
Go on! Tell ‘em what you think!
SONG: “LET IT GROW”
EXT. TOWN SQUARE - PRESENT - CONTINUOUS
The Singing Delivery Man stares at all the people.
SINGING DELIVERY MAN
You don’t know me, but my name’s
Cy,
I’m just the But it seems worth a try, So I say let
O’Hare Deliver Guy, like trees might be
it grow
Ted and Audrey smile at this. O’Hare frowns. What? Then a couple, DAN and ROSE, step forward, emboldened by the Singing Delivery Man’s words. They address the crowd.

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax
1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 98.
DAN
My name is Dan
ROSE
And my name’s Rose.
Standing next to them is their son, the Glowing Boy.
DAN AND ROSE
Our son Wesley kind of glows.
And that’s not good, so we suppose We should let it grow!
Several members of the crowd nod, agreeing. Ted’s Mom addresses the crowd.
TED’S MOM
Let it grow Let it grow
Ted looks up at his Mom, impressed by her amazing singing voice.
TED’S MOM, SINGING DELIVERY MAN, AND
MAINTENANCE WORKERS
You can’t reap what you don’t sow. Plant a seed inside the earth,
People from around the town hear them sing and walk over to join the crowd.
TED’S MOM, SINGING DELIVERY MAN, AND
MAINTENANCE WORKERS (CONT’D)
Just one way to know its worth, Let’s celebrate the world’s rebirth- -
We say let it grow!
The little girl, Marie, steps forward.
MARIE
My name’s Marie, and I am three I would really like to see a tree
The crowd reacts to her undeniable cuteness.
EVERYONE Awwwwwww...
MARIE
La la la la la la la la la la lee I say let it grow

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 99.
Grammy Norma slides down from the bulldozer and addresses the crowd.
GRAMMY NORMA
I’m Grammy Norma, I’m old, and I’ve got gray hair
But I remember when trees were everywhere
The crowd is moved by this. O’Hare can see he’s losing ground.
GRAMMY NORMA (CONT’D)
And no one had to pay for air
(pokes O’Hare with her cane)
So I say let it grow!
The whole crowd now joins in on the chorus. O’Hare can see he’s losing ground. Ted leads everyone back down towards town square.
CROWD
Let it grow
Let it grow
Like it did so long ago!
It is just one tiny seed
But it’s all we really need It’s time to change the life we lead
Time to let it grow!
Now O’Hare steps out of the middle of the crowd onto the top of his severed statue’s head.
O’HARE
My name’s O’Hare, I’m one of you, I live here in Thneedville too. The things you say just might be true,
It could be time to start anew, And maybe change my point of view...
Everyone is touched by O’Hare’s willingness to change. O’HARE (CONT’D)
Naw! I say let it die!
O’Hare now tries to get everyone singing with him.
Let it die Let it die
O’HARE (CONT’D) (MORE)

O’HARE (CONT’D)
Let it shrivel up and...
(no one’s singing along) Come on! Who’s with me? Huh?
The crowd just stares back at him. Even his own men look away.
MARIE Nobody.
SINGING DELIVERY MAN
You greedy dirtbag!
Everyone surrounds O’Hare and points to him accusingly.
CROWD
Let it grow
Let it grow
Let the love inside you show
Mooney slaps the rocket helmet to O’Hare’s head and sends him flying off screen.
CROWD (CONT’D)
Plant a seed inside the earth,

O’HARE Noooooooooo!

EXT: LERKIM - PRESENT - SAME
The Once-ler’s eyes appear in the boarded up window. He looks toward Thneedville, trying to make out the faint music he hears in the distance.
TOWNSPEOPLE (O.S.)
It is just one tiny seed But it’s all we really need
The Once-ler turns his ear to the window, but it’s still too faint. He disappears back inside his Lerkim.

Dr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 101.
INT: LERKIM - PRESENT - SAME
It’s hard to make out anything in the dark and shadowy room. Then the Once-ler’s gloved hands appear, grabbing the handle of a RUSTY OLD AXE next to the Great-Great-Great Grandfather snail on his desk. We can barely make out the silhouette of the Once-ler raising the axe over his head, then...
TOWNSPEOPLE (O.S.)
It’s time to banish all your greed
WHACK! He chops away at the boards covering his window. WHACK! CRACK! The axe breaks through the boards and sunlight shines into the room for the first time in years.
TOWNSPEOPLE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Imagine Thneedville flowered and treed!
Then, the Once-ler steps into the light and moves toward the window. We see his face for the first time. Old and wrinkled, with an enormous, Lorax-like moustache. The Old Once-ler leans out of the window and listens. Far off in the distance, he hears voices singing.
TOWNSPEOPLE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Let this be our solemn creed!
The Once-ler’s sad old eyes slowly widen as he realizes what he’s hearing. Tears begin to well up as he looks down at the “Unless” stones below him, then back toward Thneedville. A proud smile creeps across his face.
ONCE-LER Thank you, Ted.
EXT: TOWN SQUARE - PRESENT - SAME
The crowd of people watch as Ted and Audrey prepare to plant the little seed into the ground. Rocks surround the hole in a protective circle (an echo of what the Lorax and animals did earlier).
EVERYONE
We say let it grow (in Thneedville)
Audrey leans in and surprises Ted with a kiss on the cheek. His eyes go wide.
EVERYONE (CONT’D)
We say let it grow (it’s a brand new dawn)

Grammy Norma walks over with a watering can as Ted plants the seed. She waters it and the tree begins to grow towards camera in time-lapse.
EXT: LERKIM - PRESENT - DAY
Cross dissolve from the sapling in Town Square to one growing in the desolate wasteland outside of the Lerkim.
The Old Once-ler steps outside with a watering can in hand. He makes his way over to the UNLESS stones where some small patches of grass are beginning to grow around the tiny Truffula tree.
The Once-ler carefully sprinkles water on a few saplings and smiles. Then, he hears a faint sound off in the distance. The same sound he heard when the Lorax disappeared into the sky years ago.
He looks up and sees the smoggy clouds beginning to part. A ray of sunshine falls upon him and a SWOMEE-SWAN swoops down from above. The amazed Once-ler watches the bird fly by then turns to the UNLESS stones where he sees--
The Lorax. Floating back down to the stones. Smiling. The Once-ler can’t contain himself and LAUGHS IN JOY.
LORAX
You done good, beanpole. You done
good.
The Old Once-ler kneels down and gives him a hug.
LORAX (CONT’D) By the way, nice mustache.
